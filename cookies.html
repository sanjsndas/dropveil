            <p class="mb-8">This Cookie Policy explains how Dropveil Irrigation Services ("we", "us", "our") uses cookies and similar tracking technologies when you visit our website (www.dropveilgardening.com). By using our website, you consent to our use of cookies in accordance with this policy. This policy explains what cookies are, how we use them, the types of cookies we use, and how you can manage your cookie preferences.</p>
            
            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>1. What Are Cookies?</h3>
                <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer, smartphone, or other device when you visit websites. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and to provide information to website owners. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your device's storage and can be used for various purposes such as remembering your preferences, analyzing website usage, and delivering targeted advertising. Cookies are not harmful and cannot execute code or transmit viruses. Most websites use cookies to improve user experience and functionality.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>2. Types of Cookies We Use</h3>
                <p>We use several types of cookies on our website, including: Strictly Necessary Cookies (essential for website functionality), Performance Cookies (collect information about how visitors use our site), Functionality Cookies (remember your preferences), and Targeting/Advertising Cookies (deliver relevant ads). Each type serves a specific purpose in enhancing your experience. We classify cookies as either "first-party" (set by us) or "third-party" (set by other organizations we work with). The specific cookies we use are detailed in our Cookie Settings panel which you can access at any time.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>3. Strictly Necessary Cookies</h3>
                <p>These essential cookies are crucial for basic website functionality and cannot be disabled without affecting how our site operates. They enable core features like security, network management, and accessibility. Typically, these cookies are set in response to service requests like setting your privacy preferences or filling out forms. They don't store personally identifiable information and are usually only set when you take specific actions. You can set your browser to block these cookies, but some parts of the site won't work properly in that case.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>4. Performance Cookies</h3>
                <p>Performance cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our website by collecting and reporting information anonymously. These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve site performance. The information collected is aggregated and anonymous. We use services like Google Analytics to track which pages are most popular, how visitors move around the site, and if they experience any errors. These cookies don't collect information that identifies visitors, helping us improve the user experience while maintaining privacy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>5. Functionality Cookies</h3>
                <p>These cookies enable enhanced functionality and personalization such as remembering your preferences (like region/language selection) and login details. Without these cookies, certain features may become unavailable. For example, they might remember your preferred text size or your decision to complete a survey. They may also be used to provide services you've requested such as watching an embedded video. The information collected is anonymized and doesn't track your browsing activity on other sites. Some functionality cookies are essential for the proper operation of certain website features.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>6. Targeting/Advertising Cookies</h3>
                <p>These cookies may be set through our site by advertising partners to deliver relevant ads on other websites. They work by uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. The data collected might be shared with third parties for these purposes, helping to measure ad effectiveness. You may see ads that are more relevant to you based on your browsing history and interests. These cookies don't store directly identifiable personal information but may link to information stored elsewhere. You can manage these cookies through our Cookie Settings panel without affecting site functionality.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>7. First-Party vs. Third-Party Cookies</h3>
                <p>First-party cookies are set by our website and can only be read by our site, which helps us provide a better user experience. Third-party cookies are set by organizations other than Dropveil, such as analytics services or advertising networks. These may track your use of our site and other websites for various purposes as described in this policy. While we carefully select our third-party partners, their cookie policies are governed by their own terms. We provide links to these policies in our Cookie Settings for your reference.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>8. Session vs. Persistent Cookies</h3>
                <p>Session cookies are temporary files that are deleted when you close your browser, used to maintain your session while browsing our site. Persistent cookies remain on your device for a set period (from days to years) and are activated each time you visit our site. Session cookies help with navigation between pages efficiently, while persistent cookies remember your preferences for future visits. We use a combination of both to provide an optimal experience. Most persistent cookies we set expire within one year unless you delete them earlier.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>9. How We Use Cookies</h3>
                <p>We use cookies to personalize content, provide social media features, analyze traffic, and serve targeted ads. They help us understand which parts of our site are most popular and where we could make improvements. Cookies enable functionality like remembering your location preferences, sign-in details, and items in your cart (if applicable). They also help us combat fraud and ensure security. Data collected through cookies may be combined with other information we collect about you, unless it's an anonymous cookie. We never sell this data to third parties.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>10. Cookie Lifespan</h3>
                <p>The lifespan of a cookie depends on its purpose: session cookies last only for the duration of your visit, while persistent cookies remain until their expiration date or until you delete them. We regularly review cookie durations to ensure we're only keeping data for as long as necessary. Some essential cookies are renewed every time you visit our site to maintain functionality. Analytical cookies typically persist for up to 2 years to help us analyze trends. Advertising cookies may last longer to recognize your device but we provide easy ways to refresh your consent.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>11. Cookie Consent</h3>
                <p>When you first visit our site, you'll see a banner asking for your consent to use non-essential cookies. You can accept all, decline all, or customize your preferences via our Cookie Settings panel. Your consent preferences are stored in a cookie so we can remember your choices (unless you clear cookies). Essential cookies don't require consent as they're necessary for website operation. You can change your preferences at any time by clicking "Cookie Settings" in the footer. Not accepting certain cookies may affect site functionality and personalization.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>12. Managing Cookie Preferences</h3>
                <p>You can manage cookies through your browser settings (though this affects all websites) or through our Cookie Settings panel which lets you control cookies by category. Most browsers allow you to block/delete cookies, accept them from specific sites, or be notified when a cookie is set. Our Cookie Settings provide granular control where you can toggle categories on/off. Note that blocking all cookies might prevent certain website features from working properly. Mobile device users may need to adjust settings in both their browser and operating system.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>13. Cookie Settings Panel</h3>
                <p>Our Cookie Settings panel (accessible via a link in the footer) provides detailed information about each cookie category and lets you enable/disable them individually. The panel shows expiration times, purposes, and whether cookies are first- or third-party. Changes apply immediately, though you may need to refresh the page. Some changes might require you to re-enter information. Your preferences are stored in a dedicated cookie that remembers your selections for 365 days. Screenshots in our help section demonstrate how to use the panel effectively.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>14. Browser-Specific Instructions</h3>
                <p>Cookie management options vary by browser. In Chrome: Settings > Privacy > Cookies. In Firefox: Options > Privacy & Security > Cookies. In Safari: Preferences > Privacy > Manage Website Data. In Edge: Settings > Cookies and Site Permissions. For mobile browsers, check your device settings and browser app settings. Our help center provides detailed guides for all major browsers. Blocking all cookies may prevent pages from displaying correctly and disable certain features. Some browser extensions provide additional cookie management tools.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>15. Third-Party Cookies and Services</h3>
                <p>We work with trusted partners who may set cookies when you use our site, including Google (analytics, advertising), Facebook (social plugins), and various service providers. These companies have their own privacy policies and may combine our data with other information they've collected. We carefully vet third-party services and sign Data Processing Agreements where possible. Links in our Cookie Settings provide direct access to third-party cookie policies. You may need to manage preferences separately on their platforms, especially for advertising cookies that track you across sites.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>16. Google Analytics Cookies</h3>
                <p>We use Google Analytics cookies (_ga, _gid) to understand how visitors engage with our site. They collect anonymous data including visitor numbers, popular pages, and traffic sources. These cookies don't identify individuals and IP addresses are anonymized before storage. You can opt-out of Google Analytics tracking by installing their browser add-on or adjusting our Cookie Settings. Data is aggregated and helps us improve content and user experience. Google's privacy practices are detailed in their own policies which we link to for transparency.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>17. Social Media Cookies</h3>
                <p>Social media cookies are set by platforms like Facebook and Twitter when you use their sharing buttons/plugins on our site. They may track your activity even if you don't click the button (if logged into those services). These cookies help personalize your experience on their platforms and measure ad effectiveness. We don't control these cookies - you'll need to manage preferences via the respective social networks. Our data is never directly shared with social platforms unless you explicitly choose to interact with their features. Some embedded social content may set additional cookies.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>18. Advertising and Retargeting</h3>
                <p>We may use cookies from ad networks (Google Ads, Facebook Pixel) to show you relevant ads after you visit our site (retargeting). These cookies track that you visited our site and may combine with information from other sources. You can opt-out through our Cookie Settings or via industry initiatives like YourAdChoices or the NAI. We don't share personal data with advertisers unless you provide explicit consent. Ad cookies help support our free content by allowing us to earn small commissions from qualified purchases or leads generated through our site.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>19. Do Not Track Signals</h3>
                <p>Some browsers offer "Do Not Track" (DNT) settings that signal websites not to track your browsing. While we respect user privacy, our site doesn't currently respond to DNT signals due to lack of standardization across platforms. Instead, we provide granular cookie controls through our Cookie Settings panel that offer similar privacy protections. Industry groups continue to work on DNT standards, and we may implement support in the future if a consensus emerges. Currently, using our Cookie Settings provides more precise control than DNT.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>20. GDPR and CCPA Compliance</h3>
                <p>Our cookie practices comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). We provide clear information, obtain consent before setting non-essential cookies, and offer easy opt-out methods. Under GDPR, you have rights to access, correct, or request deletion of your data. CCPA provides similar rights for California residents. Our Data Protection Officer can be contacted via privacy@dropveilgardening.com. We conduct regular reviews to ensure ongoing compliance with evolving regulations in all jurisdictions we operate.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>21. Cookie Security</h3>
                <p>We implement security measures to protect cookies from unauthorized access or tampering. Secure cookies are transmitted only over HTTPS connections. Sensitive information is never stored in cookies directly - they typically contain only identifiers that link to server-side data. Our IT team monitors for suspicious activity and implements industry-standard protections against cookie hijacking and cross-site scripting attacks. Session cookies in particular are designed to expire quickly to limit risk. Despite these measures, users should protect their devices with antivirus software and keep browsers updated.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>22. Impact of Disabling Cookies</h3>
                <p>Blocking all cookies may prevent access to certain features like account login, shopping carts, or personalized content. Some pages might not display correctly, and site performance could be affected. Functionality that depends on cookies (like remembering preferences) won't work. However, core informational content remains accessible. We suggest enabling at least strictly necessary cookies (which you can't decline through our settings) for basic functionality. <div class="cookie-point">
                <h3>23. Cookie Policy Updates</h3>
                <p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. When we make changes, we will notify you by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about our use of cookies and your options. Continued use of our website after any changes indicates your acceptance of the new terms. If significant changes are made, we may also provide additional notice through our website or via email.</p>

                <h3>26. Cookies and Mobile Devices</h3>
                <p>Cookies function similarly on mobile devices as they do on desktop computers. Mobile browsers also store cookies, and users can manage their preferences through device settings or browser options. Our website is optimized for mobile use, and we ensure that cookie consent banners and settings are accessible on all devices. If you use our mobile app, cookies may also be used to enhance your experience, and you can manage preferences within the app settings.</p>

                <p>We may partner with third-party advertising networks to deliver ads that are relevant to you based on your interests. These networks may use cookies to track your browsing behavior across different sites. You can opt-out of personalized advertising through the settings provided by these networks. We do not control the cookies set by these third parties, and we encourage you to review their privacy policies for more information on how they handle your data.</p>

                <h3>30. Cookie Policy for Children</h3>
