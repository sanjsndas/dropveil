                <h3>3. What information should I provide when requesting a quote?</h3>
                <p>For accurate quotes, please provide your property address, approximate square footage requiring irrigation, water source information, soil type, existing system details (if applicable), preferred irrigation type, and any special requirements. Photos of your property help us understand the scope of work. Be sure to mention if you have water conservation concerns, difficult terrain, or other factors that might affect installation. The more details you provide, the more accurate our estimate will be.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>4. How do I check the status of my service request?</h3>
                <p>You can check service request status by logging into your account on our website or by calling our customer service line at (123) 456-7890.

            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>5. What payment methods do you accept?</h3>
                <p>We accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, personal checks, and cash. Payment is due upon service completion unless prior credit arrangements have been made. For larger projects, we may require a deposit before work begins. All major credit card payments are processed securely through encrypted payment gateways. Electronic invoices are available upon request, and we offer payment plans for qualifying service packages over $1,000.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>6. Do you offer service contracts or maintenance plans?</h3>
                <p>Yes, we offer annual maintenance contracts that include seasonal system activation/winterization, monthly inspections, priority scheduling, and discounts on parts and labor. Our maintenance plans are customizable based on your system size and needs. Contract customers receive 10% off additional services and guaranteed response times. Our maintenance team will provide detailed service reports after each visit. Ask our customer service representatives about plan options and pricing.</p>

            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>7. What areas do you serve?</h3>
                <p>We primarily service the New York metropolitan area including all five boroughs, Nassau County, and Westchester County. Our service radius extends approximately 50 miles from our Manhattan office. Some rural or extreme outskirts areas may incur additional travel fees.

            </div>

            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>8. How do I prepare for my scheduled service visit?</h3>
                <p>Please ensure clear access to all irrigation equipment and water sources. Mark any underground utilities if known. Secure pets and remove any obstacles from work areas. Have your water bills available if discussing conservation. If it's an irrigation system checkup, make note of any problem zones. Our technicians will need access to your water main and/or irrigation controller. For landscaping projects, clearly mark any plants needing special attention.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>9. What warranties do you offer?</h3>
                <p>All installations come with a 1-year workmanship warranty covering labor and a manufacturer's warranty on parts (typically 2-5 years depending on components). Maintenance plan customers receive extended warranty coverage up to 3 years. Our warranties cover defects in materials and workmanship but not damage from weather, misuse, or unauthorized repairs. Warranty claims require documentation of proper maintenance. We'll explain all warranty terms before beginning your project.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>10. Do I need to be home during service?</h3>
                <p>You're not required to be home for routine maintenance if we have access to your irrigation system. However, we recommend someone be present for initial consultations, system installations, and complex repairs. For all visits, our technicians will provide arrival notifications and require access to water sources and controller panels. We can arrange lockbox or key code access if you won't be available. Final paperwork and payments can be handled electronically if needed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>11. How can I save money on water bills with your systems?</h3>
                <p>Our smart irrigation technologies can reduce outdoor water usage by 30-50% compared to traditional systems. We offer water audits, rain sensors, soil moisture monitors, and weather-based controllers that automatically adjust watering schedules. Many of our clients see a return on investment within 18-24 months through water savings. We can also help you qualify for municipal water conservation rebates that offset upgrade costs. Ask about our water-saving solutions tailored to your landscape.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="contact-point">

                <p>Absolutely! Our irrigation design services include site analysis, water pressure/flow testing, zoning plans, equipment specification, and water conservation strategies. We'll create a customized system that meets your landscape's needs while maximizing efficiency. Our designs consider plant types, sun exposure, soil conditions, and local water restrictions.

            </div>

            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>14. How often should my irrigation system be serviced?</h3>
                <p>We recommend quarterly maintenance for most residential systems (spring startup, two summer checkups, fall winterization). Commercial systems or those with complex features may need monthly attention. Regular maintenance prevents costly repairs, ensures water efficiency, and prolongs system life. Our technicians inspect sprinklers, valves, controllers, sensors, and water pressure during each visit. Service frequency depends on system age, usage, and local water conditions - we'll advise what's optimal for your situation.</p>
